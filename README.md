technologies can also produce bio-solids, such as bio-
char and ash (up to 48 t/ha-year for both), which can be used to improve soil quality by increasing their nutri
-
ent- and moisture-holding capacity, support microbial communities and promote the root activity [66]. Ash from Azolla contains alkali elements (Li, Na, K, Mg, Ca) as well as microelements such as Fe, Mn and Cu making it a good candidate for use as fertilizer [24, 67].
Biodiesel production
Growing on wastewaters, the annual theoretical yield of crude lipids from A. filiculoides can be estimated as 1.68  t/ha-year. This amount can be increased to 8  t/ha-year if the plant will grow under natural conditions with productivity around 100  t dw/ha-year. This oil produc
-
tivity is significantly higher than from soybean (0.44  t/ha-year), sunflower (0.78  t/ha-year), rapeseed (1.17  t/ha-year) and oil palm (6.0 t/ha-year), but lower than the theoretical yield from microalgae (up to 73  t/ha-year, for Nannochloropsis sp.) [28, 29, 68]. As Azolla/A. azol
-
lae contain a range of C16:0, C18:2 and C18:3 fatty acids, their conversion to methyl esters means that the resultant biodiesel meets the crucial requirements of fuel density, cetane number and iodine value for biodiesel set by the EN14214 standard [28].
Ethanol production
The theoretical ethanol production from A. filiculoides is 9.3 t/ha-year (11.7  × 10
3 L/ha/year, based on specific 
volume of ethanol  =  0.789  g/mL) which is lower than 
ethanol production from sugarcane (25  × 103 L/ha-year), 
close to that from corn stover (13.31  ×  103  L/ha-year), 
but higher than from miscanthus (2.3  × 103 L/ha-year), 
willow (0.3  × 103 L/ha-year) and poplar (1.3  × 103 L/ha-
year) (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Bio-hydrogen production
The high biomass production yield, chemical composition (C/N ratio) and high bio-hydrogen yield of 2.2  mol/mol substrate make Azolla a competitive feedstock for hydro
-
gen production compared with other bioenergy crops (Additional file 1 : Table S1, Additional file 10: Table S6).
Conclusions
The chemical composition of Azolla’s biomass contains a unique combination of bioenergy molecules found in lignocellulosic, starch- and oil-producing terrestrial bio
-
energy crops, microalgal and cyanobacterial species. Ability to grow on wastewaters and high growth and productivity rates makes Azolla species a most attractive feedstock for low cost, low energy demanding, near zero maintenance system for production of a wide spectrum of biofuels.Methods
Growing Azolla
Azolla filiculoides and Azolla pinnata were from RMIT University’s collection of aquatic plants. The plants were collected, rinsed in deionized water and any unwanted debris removed. Experiments were carried out in plastic containers (500  mL) filled with 100 and 50  % of the sele
-
nium-supplemented synthetic wastewater (SeSW) (Addi -
tional file  4: Table S3). The containers were initially seeded 
with the same amount of fresh A. filiculoides, sufficient to cover the entire water surface with a single layer of fronds. The containers were placed in a 23 °C growth chamber with 16 h photoperiod and a photosynthetic photon flux density of 50 µmol/m
2/s. The solution in each container was mixed 
every day. Three replicates were included for each treat -
ment. Destructive sampling was conducted to evaluate the Se, ammonia, nitrate and phosphate contents every day over 5  days. Solution samples were analysed for ammonia cati
-
ons, nitrate and phosphate anions and pH. Concentrations of cations and anions were measured using the ion chro
-
matography system Dionex ICS-1100 (Thermo Scientific, USA). The dry weights were determined immediately after sampling by drying samples at 80  °C overnight. Growth was monitored by from fresh weight using the following equation: 
µ=(lnNtn−lnNt0)/slashbig
(tn−t0), where Ntn was 
the fresh weight and Nt0 was the fresh weight at day 0. The 
chemical composition of Azolla biomass was analysed by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). Starch was analysed by starch (HK) assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
Selenium extraction and measurements
SeSW samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the experimental period, acidified with concen
-
trated HNO3 to pH 2 and kept at 4 °C. Plants from each 
treatment were rinsed with Milli-Q water, blotted on filter paper and dried at 70 °C overnight. Dried samples were then ground using a mortar and pestle and aliquots (100 mg) were weighed into glass tubes and digested with HNO
3 (68.5  %):HClO4 (70  %) mixture (1  mL, 10:1, v/v) 
in a dry heating block at 100  °C for 30  min [69]. After cooling to room temperature, samples were filtered (Whatman number 42, 11  cm) and diluted to 10  mL with Milli-Q water. Plant extracts and wastewater were analysed for total selenium concentration by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent Technologies, Model 4500 series 300).
Shrimp toxicity test
Adult freshwater glass shrimp, Paratya australiensis, from RMIT’s collection were used. The shrimps were accli
-
matized over 2  weeks before commencing the toxicity tests. They were maintained in 20-L glass tanks contain

ing dechlorinated filtered water at 24  °C, with a 16:8  h Page 13 of 17
 Miranda et al. Biotechnol Biofuels  (2016) 9:221 
light:dark photoperiod and a light intensity of 400 to 600 lx. 
The shrimps were fed daily with algae wafers and trout pel -
lets. However, they were not fed for 24 h before the com -
mencement of the tests. The toxicity tests were performed under static conditions in 500-mL glass beakers over 96 h. The LC
50 was calculated for each treatment using a Pro -
bit analysis. All the statistical tests were analysed using a ToxRat 3Software (ToxRat Solutions GmbH).
Ethanol production
Enzymatic treatment of Azolla
The samples of A. filiculoides and A. pinnata which had 
been washed in MilliQ water was dried in a hot air oven at 70 °C overnight and then ground. For de-lignification, the sample (5  g) was mixed with 25  mM NaOAc (pH 5.5) and autoclaved at 121  °C, 15  lbs, for 20  min. Enzy
-
matic saccharification was performed according to [62]. In brief, 500  µL of a-amylase (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 50  µL α-amyloglucosidase (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were added per gram of dry biomass and incubated at 37  °C with shaking at 250 rpm for 5 h. For the second step, the pH was adjusted to 4.8, and 200  µL of cellulase (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 70 µL of glucosidase (Cellobiase) from Aspergillus niger (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) per gram of dry biomass were added. The suspension was shaken at 50 °C for 24 h. Glucose released was determined with a glucose assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, USA).
Ethanol fermentation
Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown from a slope cul -
ture by inoculation into 200  mL of Difco™ Yeast and 
Mould (YM) broth 0.3 % (w/v) yeast extract, 0.3 % (w/v) malt extract, 0.5 % (w/v) peptone and 1 % (w/v) dextrose. The yeast was grown in this medium for 3 days at 25 °C. Before inoculation of the hydrolysate, the yeast was cen
-
trifuged (3000  rpm, 3  min) and then resuspended in growth media. Ethanol fermentations were carried out by S. cerevisiae (1.0  × 10
7 cells/mL) added to 500 µL of 
each hydrolysate with and without additional nutrients (0.5 g/L yeast extract and 0.5 g/L peptone) and fermented at 28 °C and 150 rpm for 48 h. Then samples were trans
-
ferred to screw-cap tubes and were heated at 100 °C for 5 min to terminate the fermentation. Samples were cen
-
trifuged, and the supernatants were assessed for ethanol by gas chromatography.

Microorganism, media and growth condition
Enterobacter cloacae DT-1 (Gene Bank accession num -
ber: JX885522) isolated previously was employed [58]. This strain was routinely maintained anaerobically in BSH medium. BSH medium was composed of (g/L): peptone; 2, yeast extract; 1, NaCl
2; 2, K2HPO4; 0.230, KH2PO4; 4.035, 4  mL (4×) of trace solution and 4  mL

0.05, H3BO3; 0.01, N(CH2COOH)3; 4.5, CaCl2.2H20; 0.01, 
Na2MoO4; 0.01, CoCl2.6H2O; 0.01, MgCl2.6H2O; 00.2, 
FeCl3; 0.1, CuCl2.6H2O; 0.05. Vitamin solution was com -
posed of (g/L); riboflavin; 0.025, citric acid; 0.02, folic acid; 0.01, and para-amino benzoic acid, 0.01. The pH of the BSH medium was adjusted to 7.5 and incubation temperature was set at the optimum of 37 °C.
Acid pre‑treatment of Azolla filiculoides biomass
Ten grams of dried A. filiculoides biomass sample was 
hydrolysed in 1  % sulphuric acid by autoclaving for 60  min at 120  °C. The hydrolysed biomass was centri
-
fuged at 10,000  rpm for 10  min, and the supernatant (designated as acid-treated prehydrolysate) was sepa
-
rated. The pre-treated solid biomass was processed for enzymatic treatment to obtain the hydrolyzed sugars. The acid-treated prehydrolysate of the A. filiculoides biomass sample was analysed for reduced sugar concen
-
tration and employed further to use as feedstock for bio-hydrogen production by E. cloacae DT-1.
Enzymatic saccharification of Azolla filiculoides biomass
The pre-treated A. filiculoides biomass pellet was pro -
cessed for enzymatic hydrolysis for its conversion to reducing sugars. The pre-treated A. filiculoides biomass sample was acidified with RO water; the pH was reduced to 5 and enzymatic treatment was conducted at 50  °C for 24  h by adding the enzyme cellulase. The hydro

gen production by E. cloacae DT-1.
Batch dark fermentation experiments
Laboratory-scale batch fermentative hydrogen produc -
tion studies were conducted in 2000  mL serum bottles (batch reactors) containing 160 mL of anaerobically pre
-
pared BSH medium [59, 70] supplemented separately 
with acid-treated prehydrolysate (50  % v/v, 11  g/L of reducing sugars) and enzymatically hydrolyzed sug
-
ars (33  % v/v, 4.8  g/L reducing sugar) as feedstock. The initial pH of the media was maintained at 7.5, and 10 % (v/v) freshly grown DT-1 culture was used as inoculum. The bottles were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h under static conditions. Biogas generated during the fermentation process was collected under decreased partial pressure of H
2 (by reducing the total pressure of biogas in the head 
space of the fermenter). This entailed using a water dis -
placement system involving an inverted water-filled bot -
tle to exert pressure on the head space of the fermenter which allowed displacement of the biogas immediately Page 14 of 17 Miranda et al. Biotechnol Biofuels  (2016) 9:221 
after its generation within the batch fermenter. Volumet -
ric biogas production was monitored by measuring the 
displaced water collected in a graduated inverted water displacement system containing saline solution at ambi

ent temperature. All experiments were performed in duplicate. Qualitative detection of hydrogen was done by gas chromatography.
Analytical methods
The composition of the biogas generated in the head space during the dark fermentation process was ana
-
lysed by gas chromatography (7890A, Agilent Technolo -
gies, USA) by following the protocols of Subudhi et  al. [58]. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC, 
Agilent 1100 series, USA) using a Sugar-PAK.1 column (Water Research, USA) was used for the detection of etha
-
nol. Water was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. All the analyses were performed in duplicate. Sugar concentrations were measured by the DNS method.
Hydrothermal liquefaction
Hydrothermal liquefaction experiments were conducted in a 100-mL high-pressure autoclave (Parr reactor) made of hastelloy at different reaction conditions of temperature and residence time. In a typical hydrothermal liquefaction experiment, the reactor was loaded with A. filiculoides and water as a solvent (1:6 by weight). The reactor was purged five times with nitrogen to remove the air. Reac
-
tants were agitated with a stirrer (~200 rpm). The temper -
ature was then raised to the desired value and maintained at that level for 15 min. The pressure during the process was autogenous, with maximum pressure in the range of 60–83  bar under the different reaction conditions. After the reaction, the procedure for separation of bio-oil1, bio-residue and bio-oil2 was as given in [40]. The experiments were repeated several times and the deviation of the liquid yields was within 1 %. The equations used to calculate the yield of various fractions were as follows:
Conversion (%)=W1−W2
W1×100
Bio-oil yield (wt% )=Wether soluble
W1×100
Bio-oil2yield (wt% )=Wacetone soluble
W1×100
Solid residue yield (wt% )=Wsolid
W1×100
Gas yield (wt% )=W(vessel+feed+water )before HTU −W(vessel+feed+water )after HTU
Amount of feed taken (g)+amount of water added (g)×100where W1 is the weight of Azolla feed; W2 is the weight of 
bio-residue; W ether soluble is the weight of ether-soluble 
bio-oil (bio-oil1); and W acetone soluble is the weight of 
acetone soluble bio-oil (bio-oil2). All yields were calcu -
lated by dry material.
TG-DTG of A. filiculoides was carried out on a Shi -
madzu DTG-60 under N2 flow. The elemental analysis 
was conducted in an Elementar Vario micro cube unit. Moisture content was obtained using an HR-83 Met
-
tler Toledo Halogen Moisture Analyzer. The 1H NMR 
spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 Plus instrument using CDCl
3 as a solvent. X-ray diffraction 
patterns of sample powders were collected by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer fitted with a Lynx eye high-speed strip detector and a Cu Kα radiation source. Diffraction patterns in the 2°–80° region were recorded with a 0.04 step size (step time  = 4 s). The FT-IR spec

tra were recorded on a Nicolet 8700 FTIR spectrometer with the sample powder diluted in KBr. SEM images were obtained with an FEI Quanta 200  F using a tung
-
sten filament doped with lanthanum hexaboride (LaB6) 
as an X-ray source, fitted with an ETD (Everhart–Thorn -
ley detector), which preferentially worked as a secondary electron detector.
The samples for SEM were dispersed on an adhesive-
coated carbon paper and then were gold coated.
The organic fraction of the bio-oil was analysed 
using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS, Agilent 7890B). The carrier gas was He, and col
-
umn flow rate was one mL  min−1. An HP-1 column 
(25 m  × 0.32 mm  × 0.17 µm) was used for the separa -
tion. The oven was set at 50 °C for 2 min, followed by a heating rate of 5 °C min
−1–280 °C at which it was held for 
5 min. The injected volume was 0.4 µL in splitless mode.
TOC analysis of feed and bio-char was performed 
using a Shimadzu TOC-L unit with solid sample mod -
ule SSM-5000A. The volatile matter was calculated by measuring the weight loss in the sample after placing it in a muffle furnace at 950 °C for 2 min, similar to ASTM D3175. Volatile matter and ash analysis of the feed was carried out using oven dried feedstock.
